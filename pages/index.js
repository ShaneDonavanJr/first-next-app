          Hello, about me. I am currently working at Circle Logistics, where I leverage MongoDB, React, and Python to help with automation, web scraping, and our own in-house website with applications and reports. I also work with Power BI, SQL, Google Sheets, and a machine that makes espressos for me several times a day.

        In my freetime I wonâ€™t turn down a poker game, I run several times a week, and travel every year. I also like talking about the tools I use if you have any questions.{' '}
